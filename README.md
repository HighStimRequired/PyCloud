Feature Highlights
Built-in Stopwords Toggle

Check “Use Default English Stopwords” to combine the default set with your own excluded words.
Color Pickers

Background Color: Button that opens a color chooser and applies the chosen color to the background color entry.
Text Color: Button that opens a color chooser and appends the chosen color to the font color(s) entry. Enter multiple colors (e.g., #FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF) for more variety.
Max Words & Max Font Size

Sliders that let you quickly change how dense and large the words can be.
Collocations

Turn them on/off so multi-word phrases (like “New York”) either show up as a single token or get split.
Random Seed

Enter an integer (e.g., 42) if you want to reproduce the exact same layout every time you generate the word cloud. Leave it blank or input invalid text to skip.
Custom TTF Font

If you have a .ttf file (punk style, sci-fi style, etc.), browse and select it. The word cloud will use that typeface. Otherwise, it defaults to whatever WordCloud uses natively.
